# Overview

As Iâ€™ve been digging deeper into systems programming, I wanted to get practical with C++ and see how it handles things like memory, performance, and object-oriented design. Coming from higher-level languages, I was especially interested in the control C++ gives you and what it costs in complexity.

This to-do list manager is a simple console app that let me explore core C++ features like class design, file I/O, and RAII. It supports adding, viewing, completing, and removing tasks, with everything saved between sessions. Working on it helped me understand how C++ manages resources without a garbage collector, and gave me a real feel for separating code into headers and source files, and using the STL effectively.

# Future Work

- Add priority levels and due dates to tasks with automatic sorting capabilities
- Implement search and filter functionality to handle larger task lists efficiently
- Create a configuration system for customizable file paths and display preferences
- Add data validation and error recovery for corrupted save files
- Implement task categories/tags with color-coded console output
- Add unit tests using a framework like Google Test to ensure code reliability
- Optimize file I/O operations for better performance with large datasets
- Create a cross-platform build system using CMake for easier distribution
